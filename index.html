								<h2>What is meditation?<br />
								And why it is so important?</h2>
								<p>Meditation isn’t about becoming a different person, a new person, or even a better person. It’s about training in awareness and getting a healthy sense of perspective.  <br />
								You’re not trying to turn off your thoughts or feelings. You’re learning to observe them without judgment. And eventually, you may start to better understand them as well.</p>

								<h2>It's meditation practice, <br />
								not meditation perfect</h2>
								<p>There’s no such thing as perfect meditation. Sometimes your focus will wander or you’ll forget to follow your breath. That’s OK. It’s part of the experience. What’s most important is to meditate consistently. It’s one of those things where the journey is more important than the destination.</p>

								<h2>Meditation is a skill<br /></h2>
								<p>Learning to meditate is like learning any other skill. Think of it like exercising a muscle that you’ve never really worked out before. It takes consistent practice to get comfortable. And it’s usually easier if you have a teacher. We’ve got you covered there.</p>

								<h2>Trouble meditating?</h2>
								<p><i>Advice on some common meditation issues.</i></p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li>
									<h3>Am I doing this right?</h3>
									<p>Doubt inevitably shows up in our meditation practice. It’s natural. "Am i meditating correctly?" is a common concern, but the real problem only occurs when we buy into that doubt. Don’t forget, no matter what the thoughts are, they’re still just thoughts. And all you need to do is gently return your focus to the breath.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Restlessness</h3>
									<p>Restlessness can manifest in many different ways. It can be a body that just doesn't want to sit still and keeps fidgeting or moving. We may not be able to find that place of quiet ease and comfort. Or it might be a mind that's overly active, that's overly busy, it just doesn't seem to stop chatting away to itself. It's doing everything it can other than simply being present in this moment.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Doubt</h3>
									<p>When doubt rises in the mind, it's really tempting to buy into those thoughts. For some reason, those thoughts sound a little more important, a little more believable than the other thoughts. And like any other thoughts, the aim here, the intention is to step back and have a little bit of distance from the thoughts and the feelings. Not to buy into them, not to get swept away by them, not to get overwhelmed by them, but instead to see them clearly and to let them go.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Finding a comfortable position</h3>
									<p>However you choose to do your meditation, it's going to involve either sitting, standing, or lying down in one of the recommended positions for meditating. For many people, it can be a challenge to sustain a sitting position. Here's a helpful tip: The way the back sits is dependent very much on the position of the hips. So, if we tilt the hips just slightly, then it helps the back maintain that position without any kind of effort at all. It also allows the shoulders to fully relax so that we feel the weight of the hands and the arms resting on the legs.</p>
